FB2V4L
======

* Virtual Framebuffer to Virtual Video4Linux Connector

This little program connects a virtual framebuffer device to a virtual v4l
device.  This allows you to run framebuffer-enabled software (such as X
with the `fbdev` driver) and have the output turned into a video stream
which can be captured (for example with OpenBroadcast).

Requires:

* Virtual Framebuffer Module - https://github.com/Freescale/linux-module-virtfb
* V4L Loopback Module - https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback

Usage:

1. Load the above modules
2. Start a session, for example:

```
fb2v4l -f /dev/fb1 -v /dev/video3
```

You can now wrote to /dev/fb1 and the results will be shown on /dev/video3.

You can specify the dimensions using:

```
fb2v4l -w 640 -h 480 -f /dev/fb1 -v /dev/video3
```

The default size is 800x600 and it always uses 32-bit RGBA.
